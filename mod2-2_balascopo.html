			<h1>Haikyuu !!</h1>
			<p>Hinata is an ambitious young man deeply passionate about volleyball. His dream is to excel in the sport and become a professional athlete, which leads him to enroll at Karasuno High School where he encounters Tobio Kageyama. While their initial interactions are marked by rivalry, they soon transform into an unstoppable volleyball duo. Karasuno enjoys victory in numerous matches, and both Hinata and Kageyama eventually realize their shared dream of becoming professional volleyball players. Hinata's journey begins in middle school when he, despite his short stature, falls in love with volleyball after watching a national championship match. Inspired by "the small giant," he joins his school's nearly non-existent volleyball club. With determination and the recruitment of more players in his final year, they manage to compete in a tournament but are matched against the formidable Kageyama Tobio, "the king of the court." Despite a disheartening loss, Hinata remains resolute, vowing to surpass Kageyama. Now, as he starts high school, he is eager to join the volleyball team, practice diligently, and anticipate a rematch with Kageyama. However, his plans take an unexpected twist when he discovers that he and Kageyama attend the same school. While their exceptional volleyball skills could significantly benefit the team, they must learn to set aside their differences and collaborate as teammates.</p>
